        Mary had a little toad <br>
        Its skin as tough as shell <br>
        And every file that toad <br> 
        would write <br>
        It used HTML.

            This is a story. Add paragraph tags to make it better.

            Once upon a time there was a <mark>baby tiger</mark> named <sub>Talia</sub>. <sup>Talia</sup> lived in a fearsome jungle in the middle of the fearsome jungle. Talia was the most fearsome of all, though she was only a baby.

            ** We use http or https to tell the browser whether to use secure encryption to connect to a web server
            ** The URL for a file that's on your local drive will start with "file" instead. -> file:///Users/kelly/notes.html
            !! http, https, and file are protocols that the browser used them to get something
            !! "en.wikipedia.org" is the domane name this tells the browser what server to connect to.
            !! but File URLs won't have this because there is no server (/Users/kelly/notes.html)
            !! / -> file path (name of directory and the file that the URL is referring to) -> this sometimes be empty or a single slash if you're linking to the top page or homepage of a site.

        <!--
            As Kelly noted at the end of the video: 
            When you're linking to the top page (or home page) of a site, 
            the URL does not need a file path after the domain name—so you will just see a single slash at the end of the address:

            http://en.wikipedia.org/

            And often this slash will be omitted altogether:

            http://en.wikipedia.org

            This would still be considered a fully-qualified URL.

            In contrast, if we look at the URL for a file on your local system, we must give the file path—in fact, most of the URL is the file path:

            file:///Users/Kelly/notes.html

            If we took away the file path from the above, we would just have:

            file://

            Which is definitely not a fully qualified URL.

            Hypertext:
                text document included links
            Links tag: <a> thats stands for anchor -> we can't just use <a> by itself
                There are a couple things we need an <a> element to include in order to make a link:
                    1. The text that a user clicks on to follow the link
                    2. The URL of the page we're linking to -> [href(Name)="a url"(value)] (attribute)
        -->
        <!--
            The a element is an inline element. 
            It doesn't create a box on the page. 
            Links normally have the appearance of a specially highlighted piece of text.
