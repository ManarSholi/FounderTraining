00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,099
Writing in HTML is a good place to start thinking about programming,

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,419
because it lets you try out a few ideas that are really essential to programming,

3
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:12,509
but it also lets you get really quick feedback on what you're

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,199
learning because you can see everything in your web browser.

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,160
As you work through this lesson,

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,625
here are some big concepts to watch for.

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,030
Keeping an eye out for these will help you a lot.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,435
The first concept to watch for is syntax,

9
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:30,695
which is another word for the grammar rules of a language,

10
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,869
and natural languages like English have grammar rules,

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,539
and so do computer languages like HTML or Python,

12
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,435
for instance, in English, we would say,

13
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:44,215
"The dog ran through the yard," and not,

14
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,555
"Dog yard ran the the through."

15
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:49,414
That would be ungrammatical.

16
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:50,759
It wouldn't make sense,

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,619
and that's what programmers call a syntax error.

18
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,524
Like computer languages have grammar rules too,

19
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,039
rules for how you put your code together.

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,015
As you learn a new language,

21
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,140
you'll pick up on these grammar rules.

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,364
Sometimes, we'll tell you these rules explicitly.

23
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:09,160
Other times, you'll learn them by example.

24
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,314
The second thing to keep in mind is something that computer scientists call formalism.

25
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:17,995
But, sometimes programmers will call computers are stupid.

26
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,630
With a few exceptions,

27
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:22,854
computers take code totally literally,

28
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:25,320
word for word, letter for letter.

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,319
The computer cannot guess what you really mean.

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,059
It can only do what you tell it to.

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,170
For instance, in HTML,

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,750
if you want to put a title on a web page,

33
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,144
you'll write the word title inside these symbols.

34
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:43,484
If you write a typo like T-I-L-T-E instead,

35
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:45,890
the computer will not guess that you mean

36
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,545
T-I-T-L-E. You always have to be careful with spelling and punctuation in programming.

37
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,030
There's usually no auto-correct.

38
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,810
A third big idea is an aspect of

39
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,490
syntax that will keep showing up in every computer language you learn.

40
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,884
This is the concept of nesting.

41
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:06,064
It has to do with how some bits of code can go

42
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:09,704
inside other bits of code in an orderly way,

43
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,745
and this is something that we have in human language too.

44
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:17,840
For instance, when we tell a story where people talk about talking with each other.

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,450
We can use nested quote marks to say that

46
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:24,004
Jessica said that Bob told her something about Mary.

47
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:27,259
You'll see things like this in programming as well.

48
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:29,504
Now that was a little abstract, I now.

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,120
When nesting comes up,

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,675
we'll try to point it out for you,

51
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:34,805
and it will show up pretty often.

52
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:38,349
The last big idea I want you to be aware of as you learn,

53
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,039
is that there is a lot of help available.

54
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,340
There are a lot of people in the world learning to code right now.

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,564
You're one of them, and there are a lot of resources to help you learn.

56
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:52,944
One of the programmers' most important tools is documentation.

57
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,269
The manuals and tutorials that are out

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,310
there for the languages that you're learning and working with.

59
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,824
For instance, you can find out just about everything there is to know about

60
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:07,239
HTML by looking it up on the Mozilla Developer Network or MDM website.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,150
Aside from the resources that Udacity brings you,

62
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,080
there's a whole lot of help that you can find just by using your favorite search engine.
