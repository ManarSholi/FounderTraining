1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
So, you might have noticed that we have two different ways

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,060
in HTML of breaking our text into multiple lines.

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:13,349
We have the br element which is an empty element that inserts a line break into our text,

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,910
but we also have the paragraph element which isn't empty.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,675
It has contents and it treats those contents as a paragraph,

6
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:22,949
and paragraphs have breaks between them.

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,369
So, why do we have both of these?

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,135
What's the difference? Well, as it turns out,

9
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:30,260
there are a bunch of differences.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,774
What the br tag is doing,

11
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:34,964
is just ending a line.

12
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:40,950
You saw earlier how HTML doesn't care how many ordinary line breaks we put into our text,

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,370
it just flows them all together.

14
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,299
Br just tells the browser,

15
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:45,854
"Break the line here".

16
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:47,944
But what paragraph is doing,

17
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:49,490
is really very different.

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,770
It's actually doing something else besides just containing the text.

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,270
It tells the browser to create a little invisible box around the text.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,520
This box is called a block and blocks are

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,105
heavily involved in how the browser lays out text on the screen.

22
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:09,530
This block has a height and a width and it also has a margin

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,105
above and below it and that's what provides the space around the paragraph.

24
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:18,150
Now, as you use HTML for more complex projects,

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,219
you'll find out that this distinction actually comes up quite a lot.

26
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:26,605
The P element is what we call a block element because it creates a block,

27
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:28,405
one of those invisible boxes.

28
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:33,814
The elements that don't create a block like em and mark and even br,

29
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:36,344
are called inline elements.

30
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:40,670
Here are some other examples of block and inline elements.

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,350
Don't worry about remembering these right now.

32
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,019
Some of these, you haven't seen yet, but you will soon;

33
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,875
things like lists, tables,

34
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:53,935
headlines, and video players are all block elements.

35
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:56,495
The browser makes a box for each of them.

36
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:59,150
If you put a numbered list into your web page,

37
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,420
the browser has to put a box around it.

38
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,879
But things like line breaks,

39
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,644
emphasis, links to other web pages,

40
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,729
and images are all inline elements,

41
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,449
they don't make a box,

42
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:14,364
they just flow with the texts that they're used in.

43
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,580
As you learn more HTML,

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,920
you'll learn a lot more about these and many other elements.
