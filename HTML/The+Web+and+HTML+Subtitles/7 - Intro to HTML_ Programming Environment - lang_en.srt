00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,410
In this video, I'm going to show you a simple setup for working with your HTML files.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,839
On the left side here,

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,144
I have my text editor,

4
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:10,695
and on the right side I have my web browser.

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,570
Now, there are many text editors out there,

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,345
each with its own features.

7
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:18,690
Most editors have some basic features that are really handy,

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,150
like syntax highlighting to help you tell

9
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,689
the different parts of the code apart and line numbers,

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,845
so that you can easily refer to a particular line of code.

11
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:30,829
We'll show you some links to some of our favorite text editors,

12
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,225
but feel free to experiment and see which one you like the best.

13
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:37,140
If you do pick something that's not on our list,

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,255
make sure that you're using a text editor,

15
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:42,580
and not a word processor like Microsoft Word,

16
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,659
or Google Docs, or pages.

17
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,979
A text editor edits plain basic text files.

18
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,469
In contrast, a word processor does a lot more than just edit text.

19
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,929
They also add information to your files but how to format the text,

20
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,734
set the font, even insert tables and images.

21
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:03,589
If you try to edit your code in a word processor,

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,620
it may look like you've created a plain text file.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,000
But there's actually hidden information in the file that would cause your code to fail.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,739
So, again, make sure that you're using a text editor like the ones we're linking below,

25
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:18,664
and that the files you are creating are plain text files.

26
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:21,195
So, here's the basic way to work with this setup.

27
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:22,889
In my text editor,

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,420
I'm going to type some text.

29
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:29,795
Then I will save my file in order to make

30
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:33,450
sure that the browser recognizes it as an HTML file.

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,350
I'll make sure to use the.html extension on my file name.

32
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,509
Here's the folder where I saved my file.

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,905
I'm just going to click and drag this file over to my browser.

34
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,605
So, the browser opens it,

35
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:53,609
and as you can see, there's the texts that I put in my file.

36
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,989
If you're on a Mac, you may also be able to drag

37
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,254
the icon from the title bar of your text editor,

38
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,454
and drag that over to your browser.

39
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,664
That does exactly the same thing,

40
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,810
or instead of dragging the file then,

41
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,689
you can go to your browser's File menu

42
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,699
and open it from there if you'd rather do it that way.

43
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,629
So, now I have my text editor with my code over here,

44
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,289
and my browser displaying how that code gets rendered over here.

45
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:21,004
If I make a change to the code,

46
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:24,590
like adding some HTML to format it,

47
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,349
it doesn't immediately show up in the browser.

48
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,639
I have to save,

49
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,329
and then hit the refresh button,

50
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,945
and then they are the changes I made.

51
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:38,269
Now, this is just one way to do this.

52
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,570
There are lots of different ways to set up your programming environment,

53
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,995
and you should feel free to develop whatever approach works best for you.

54
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:49,400
The important thing is to have some place where you can edit your code and try things

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,520
out right along some place where you can easily see the results of those changes.

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,360
Generally, I can't write a whole bunch of code in one go because something will go wrong,

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,570
and I'll need to find the Issue and fix it.

58
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,745
When I'm working on my code,

59
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:06,849
I like to be experimenting a lot and testing the results frequently.

60
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,614
So, I can see whether the changes are behaving in the way that I expect.

61
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:12,825
So, however you set things up,

62
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:15,994
it will help you learn best if you make sure that your setup

63
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,250
helps you to get this kind of immediate feedback on your work.
