1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,605
You might have noticed this Image URL earlier.

2
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:07,075
It's from a site called placebear.com,

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,750
which has a lot of images of bears.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,474
If you want a picture of a particular size,

5
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:15,285
say 800 by 600 pixels,

6
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:18,079
placebear.com will find one for you,

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,389
as long as you're okay with it being a picture of a bear.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,910
To put this image into my notes.html file,

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,094
I'll put it in an IMG tag like so,

10
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:31,134
and when my browser opens this HTML file,

11
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:34,625
it'll know to go out to the placebear.com server,

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,125
and fetch that image,

13
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,880
and put it into the page.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,450
But, what if I have an image file right here on my own computer?

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,750
In fact, what if it's sitting in the same folder as my HTML file?

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,534
Do I have to put it on a server someplace in order to refer to it by an image tag?

17
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,194
As it turns out, I don't.

18
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:57,710
Instead, I can just put the file name in the image tag.

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,664
Now why does that work?

20
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:05,920
Well, the browser looks at the SRC attribute here and it doesn't see a full URL.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,960
It doesn't start with http:// or file:// or something like that.

22
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,589
Specifically, there's no :// anywhere in it,

23
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,314
and the browser has a rule for what to do when that happens in an HTML document.

24
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:30,355
Specifically, it looks for this file name as a variation of the HTML document's own URL.

25
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:33,620
This is called a relative URL.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,945
Now, right now my HTML file is on my own computer,

27
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:47,699
and the browser sees it with the URL: file:///Users/Karl/courses/notes.html.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,120
So, when this file refers to the relative URL kittens.jpg,

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,230
it will look for that file in the same directory.

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,250
Even though I only had to write and kittens.jpg in my HTML file,

31
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:11,500
the browser will load the same URL as file:///Users/Carl/courses/kittens.jpg.

32
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:15,375
Using the relative URL has a lot less typing,

33
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,000
but that's not the only advantage of it.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,189
If I wanted to send this Web page to someone else, well,

35
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:25,069
the HTML itself doesn't contain that kitten image file.

36
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,139
I need to send them the image file too.

37
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,299
But, if I send this file to Kelly,

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,420
it's sure not going to show up on her computer in a directory called /Users/Karl.

39
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:36,984
If I have URLs in my HTML,

40
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,255
that point to directory is on my computer,

41
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,634
and they're not going to work on someone else's computer.

42
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,314
So, as a general rule,

43
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:48,829
if you're referring to an image or a link that's on a Web server, like placebear.com,

44
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:57,540
you'll usually want to use a full URL like https://placebear.com/800/600.

45
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:00,289
But, if you're referring to an image or

46
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:04,750
another file that you're passing around along with your HTML file,

47
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,009
you should use relative URLs.

48
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,989
By the way, relative URLs are the real reason

49
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,950
that you can't make an a link to Google by just writing,

50
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,719
a href = google.com in your HTML,

51
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,189
even though Google.com works if you type it directly into your browser.

52
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:31,745
In HTML, a URL with no :// in it is always treated as a relative URL.

53
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,280
So the browser would look for a file called

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,219
Google.com which is usually not what you want.

55
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,780
So, if you want to make a link to another site,

56
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,449
you have to put the http or https on the front.
