00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,474
In this lesson, you've learned a lot of rules for how to write html.

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:09,974
These rules are like the spelling and grammar rules of a language,

3
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:13,209
but how can you be really sure that your html

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,785
is spelled correctly, and written grammatically?

5
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:20,375
For starters, you can load it up in the browser.

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,410
If it looks right in your browser,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,355
it must be okay, right?

8
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:29,339
Not quite, it might have a mistake that your browser can deal with,

9
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,454
but some other browsers can't.

10
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:35,739
It's hard enough to make browsers work the same on correct html,

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,050
and it would be a lot of work to test your html on every browser out there.

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,869
Fortunately, there's a way to check your html,

13
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,924
to make sure the syntax is right.

14
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:49,294
There are tools called HTML validators,

15
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,620
that will check for all the details.

16
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,679
Everything from tags being spelled correctly,

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,810
to some of those tricky nesting rules,

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,065
like list items have to be inside a list.

19
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:06,170
The best known HTML validator is validator.w3.org,

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,655
which is run by the W3C,

21
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,390
the World Wide Web Consortium.

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,204
That's the organization that writes the standards for html,

23
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:17,280
and other components of the web.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,019
So, they're in a pretty good position to tell you if your html is right.

25
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,594
There are three different ways you can use the validator service.

26
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:29,739
If your html is on a public web server,

27
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:35,269
you can just give the URL and it will download and check the html.

28
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:38,894
But if you're working on an html file on your own computer,

29
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:42,534
you'll want to use one of the two other options.

30
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:47,744
You can upload the file or you can copy it from your editor and paste it in.

31
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:51,344
When you do, you'll get a little report like this,

32
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,825
that tells you whether there are errors in your html.

33
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,560
If there are errors,

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,370
you'll get a message like this,

35
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:06,665
element head is missing a required instance of child element title.

36
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:09,370
That's a pretty technical way of saying,

37
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,680
''A full html document needs to have a title element which goes into the head element.''

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,700
When you get errors like this,

39
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:19,834
fix them in your text editor,

40
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:23,770
then paste or upload the new version and check it again.

41
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,534
When it's all correct,

42
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,650
you'll get a nice green message like this,

43
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,460
saying there were no errors or warnings to show.
