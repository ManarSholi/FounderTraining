1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,974
This quiz asked you which of five kinds of files are made of text.

2
00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:08,689
The first is a story that you wrote in the Atom editor.

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,649
If you write a story in Atom,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,255
it will be in plain text.

5
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,125
So, that's correct.

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:18,329
The second item on the quiz is a piece of music on your phone.

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:23,744
Well, let's see what happens if we take a music file and open it up in a text editor.

8
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:27,914
I've got an MP3 file here of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

9
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:30,554
Let me open it up in Atom.

10
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:33,375
Well, wow, what a mess,

11
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:37,619
the text editor is trying its darndest to treat the file as text,

12
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,339
but it just isn't.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,570
A text editor doesn't know what to do with an mp3.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,560
Music files are generally not text.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,394
The third is Udacity's homepage.

16
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:50,969
The homepage is made up of HTML,

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,149
and HTML is written in text.

18
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,225
So, this is correct too.

19
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:58,109
The fourth is a photo of a dog.

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,204
Photos are not text.

21
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:04,159
Browsers know how to display photos and other images,

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,674
but if you try to open it up in a text editor,

23
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:09,204
you will see a big mess,

24
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,829
just like with the mp3 music file.

25
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:13,310
To edit a photo,

26
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,500
you need photo editing software.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,655
The last is a bit tricky.

28
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:20,484
A PDF file of a legal contract.

29
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,909
When you look at a PDF in your browser,

30
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,509
or in a program like Adobe Acrobat,

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,565
you can usually see words and sentences, and stuff.

32
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:31,480
So, that seems kind of like textish,

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,049
but a PDF isn't a text file,

34
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,694
and you can't edit it in a text editor.

35
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:41,584
The same is true for word processor files from programs like MS Word.

36
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:47,659
We don't ever use a word processor to edit text files such as HTML or other programs.

37
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,759
We use a text editor.
