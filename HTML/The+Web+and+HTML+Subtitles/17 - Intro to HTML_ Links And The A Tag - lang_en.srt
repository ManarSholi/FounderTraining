1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,644
The web is built on the idea of hypertext.

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:08,673
Hypertext means that you can have textual documents,

3
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:14,140
like web pages, but that they also have references between them.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,875
On the web, those are links.

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,129
Every time you click on a link in a web page,

6
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,574
you're making use of hypertext.

7
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,769
When you write HTML,

8
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:27,059
you can link to other web pages,

9
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,324
both your own and also someone else's.

10
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:33,304
That's how a search engine works, for example.

11
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:37,914
So, here's how to make a link in your own HTML.

12
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:42,075
The element for making links is called <a>.

13
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,405
Yes, it's not called link, it's called <a>.

14
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:48,835
That stands for anchor,

15
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:53,990
because an <a> element anchors an address to a piece of text on the page.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,285
Yeah, that sounds weird to me too,

17
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:59,069
but that's how it is, at least it's short.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,810
But we can't just use <a> by itself.

19
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,939
There are a couple things we need an <a> element to include in order to make a link.

20
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,349
The text that a user clicks on to follow the link,

21
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:15,439
and the URL of the page we're linking to.

22
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,090
Here's how we're going to do that.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,870
The opening tag for the <a> element has

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,225
this extra little bit in it that we haven't seen in HTML tags before.

25
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:31,869
This href equals "a url" part.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,765
This is an example of an HTML attribute.

27
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:38,689
It's an extra piece of data that comes along

28
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:42,189
with the element and it gives it extra meaning.

29
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:46,780
The part before the equal sign is the name of the attribute,

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,004
and the part after,

31
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:52,034
in double quotes, is the value of the attribute.

32
00:01:52,034 --> 00:02:00,370
Here, the name is href and the value is http://example.net.

33
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,304
The name href stands for hypertext reference,

34
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:13,594
and it's used with <a> tags and a few other tags that link to another document.

35
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:19,719
You won't ever see it on a paragraph or an emphasis tag or something else.

36
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,824
Then, there's the contents of the <a> element,

37
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:26,134
which becomes the text that appears on the page.

38
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:29,449
Then there's the closing <a> tag.

39
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,969
You might notice that it doesn't have any attributes in it.

40
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:39,310
Attributes like href always only go in the opening tag at the beginning of an element.

41
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,300
That's pretty much all there is to making links in HTML.

42
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,120
You've just made an <a> element with a start and an end tag.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,265
The start tag has an href attribute with an equal sign,

44
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:56,875
and in double-quotes, the url of the page that we want to link to.

45
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:01,000
The contents of the element become the text the user clicks on,

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,520
and then there's a closing <a> tag.
