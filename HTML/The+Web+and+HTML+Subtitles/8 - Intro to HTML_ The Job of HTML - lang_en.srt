00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, we're going to discuss HTML,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,150
which stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,554
HTML documents are the building blocks of the web.

4
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:13,015
The web is basically made up of these documents,

5
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:15,210
and they can do a number of things.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,910
So, HTML is made up of text that the user will actually read in their browser,

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,704
and markup which tells the browser what that text should look like,

8
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,619
or how it's arranged.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,189
Within markup, there can be references to include other documents and files,

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,064
like images and videos.

11
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:37,780
Now, let's imagine this box is a web page and you've got some text,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,750
and there's an image in your page,

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,005
or like the page you're looking at now,

14
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:43,820
it's got a video in the middle of it.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,899
Now, the page you're looking at now is made up of HTML,

16
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,589
and it's got a reference to this video.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,395
An HTML can also include links to other pages.

18
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:57,005
Links let the user move around from one page to another.

19
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,410
Now, let's play around with HTML for a little bit.

20
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,879
Using your text editor,

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,565
like atom or VS Code,

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:08,719
follow along with this video by creating a new file in your text editor and saving it,

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,405
maybe calling it something like testing.html,

24
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,015
and working in that file.

25
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:18,260
Your text editor lets you work on several files at once if you like,

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,900
just make sure to save each one of them after you make changes.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,100
Then, when you want to render your HTML file,

28
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,089
just open that up with your browser.

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,575
You can usually do that by dragging the file icon onto the browser window,

30
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:35,105
or, using the open file command in the menus.

31
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:36,770
The first thing I want to show you,

32
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:40,299
is if we have some plain text in an HTML file.

33
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,715
If we were to render this as HTML with the browser,

34
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:46,109
it would look pretty much the same.

35
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,655
For the most part, plain text in the HTML shows up as plain text in the browser.

36
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:54,314
But, if we want to make the text look different,

37
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,909
we'd need to use markup,

38
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,840
which is one of the other aspects of HTML.
