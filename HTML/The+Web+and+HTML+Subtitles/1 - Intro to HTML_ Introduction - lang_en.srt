00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
Welcome. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,404
you're going to get started creating web pages.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:10,445
As you go, you'll be learning some important concepts about how computer languages work.

4
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,820
We'll be talking about what the web is,

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,759
what it's built of, and the basics of how it works.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,269
You'll get practice editing web pages using

7
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,484
a programmer's text editor and testing your work in your browser.

8
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:25,320
You'll learn the fundamentals of HTML,

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,719
the computer language that we use to structure and write web pages.

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:35,670
Also about URLs, the addresses that we use to refer to documents and sites on the web.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,660
You'll put all of this together by taking notes on what

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,750
you've learned and turning those notes into a web page.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,005
The web is a big topic.

14
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,310
So, where should we get started?

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,280
Well, how about what's the web made of?

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,505
Well, in one sense,

17
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:56,510
the web is a collection of documents written in HTML,

18
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:00,769
along with other resources such as images and videos,

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,755
as well as programs and services that interact with these documents and resources.

20
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:10,414
Everything that you can access using your web browser is part of the web.

21
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:12,920
Those resources are spread out among

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,120
thousands and thousands of different computer systems.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,265
The web is a hypertext system.

24
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:23,564
What this means is that documents, web pages, sites,

25
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:27,649
web apps can contain references to other documents

26
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,100
and users can follow those references to find related information.

27
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,449
That's what you're doing every time you,

28
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,995
say, click on a link in a blog post or a news article.

29
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:40,250
We call these references hyperlinks,

30
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,000
or links for short,

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,704
and the ability to follow them from document to document is what makes the web web-like.

32
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:52,700
This hypertext ability to refer to other information is also

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,170
used whenever a web page includes an image or a video or a piece of code.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,350
Hypertext is kind of a big deal.

35
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:03,919
All of web technology is built around this idea of

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,599
documents and other data objects that can link to each other in a standard way.

37
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,539
Exactly how this works,

38
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:14,039
well, that's what you'll see throughout the rest of this lesson.
