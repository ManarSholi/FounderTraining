1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,815
What would the web be without cat pictures,

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:07,109
or without maps, or news photos,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,160
or diagrams or banner ads?

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,085
Images are a huge part of why the web is so successful.

5
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:19,175
So, you might be wondering how to include images in your own web pages.

6
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:21,630
It probably comes as no surprise.

7
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:24,710
There's an HTML element for just that.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,995
This element is img for image,

9
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:33,469
and works a lot like the a element for links but with some important differences.

10
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,969
Now, the a element for links uses a single attribute

11
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:43,759
named href whose value is the URL of the page you want to link to.

12
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,894
But the img element uses two attributes; src and alt.

13
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:53,359
Now src stands for source and it's

14
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,604
the URL of the image that you want to appear in your webpage.

15
00:00:57,604 --> 00:01:02,854
An alt stands for alternate and it's a text description of that image.

16
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:07,515
The text that shows up here is usually called the alt text.

17
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:12,109
Now, you need to include both of those attributes when you write HTML.

18
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:16,855
The src attribute is there to tell the browser where to get the image from,

19
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:19,064
what is the source of the image.

20
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:22,039
The alt attribute is there to tell the browser

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,935
what text to show if it can't display the image.

22
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:32,090
For instance, alt text will be displayed if the file is missing from the server or if

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,120
the user's network connections stops working before that image

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,465
can be loaded which is really common on mobile for instance.

25
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,924
Or if the user can't see images,

26
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:42,769
for instance, if they're blind.

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,509
Something to keep in mind;

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,365
putting an img element into your HTML file

29
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:52,609
doesn't copy the image file into your HTML file.

30
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:56,049
It just tells the browser where to find that image file,

31
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,149
what the source of it is.

32
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,155
The image file still has to be somewhere,

33
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:04,620
whether that's on your local disk or on a server.

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,420
The img element is an empty or void element like br.

35
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,974
It doesn't have any textual contents and there's no close tag for it.

36
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:17,674
Remember, contents of an HTML element would be

37
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:22,885
text between an open and a close tag like in a p element.

38
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:24,879
In the sense that we're using here,

39
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,180
the src and the alt on an image tag are not contents,

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,485
they are HTML attributes of that element.

41
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,895
The img element is an inline element.

42
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:39,159
You can put an image right into the middle of a piece of text.

43
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,319
If the image is taller than the text around it it'll space the lines of text out.
