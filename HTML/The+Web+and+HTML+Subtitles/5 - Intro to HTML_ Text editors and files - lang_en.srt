00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
HTML documents and programs in

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,509
almost every programming language are written in text files.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,609
Let's take a look at what this means.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,969
Text files contain nothing but characters: Letters,

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,115
numbers, symbols, spaces and so on.

6
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:19,559
They don't contain any special topography,

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,089
such as bold or italics or colors.

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,109
They don't contain any photos,

9
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,309
icons or other images.

10
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,504
You can imagine text as anything you could type on an old fashioned typewriter.

11
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:34,454
Text seems like it would be very limiting,

12
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:36,689
but it's also very flexible.

13
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:39,729
It can be used for countless different things.

14
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,284
HTML is written in text,

15
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:47,414
but so are programming languages used to do data analysis or write servers.

16
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,990
There are programs that can take text input and turn it

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,370
into a musical notation or format it for a scientific paper,

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,774
or load specially organized texts into a spreadsheet.

19
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:01,094
As you look at HTML code,

20
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,480
it might look like it has a lot of weird things going on,

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,329
but it's really all just made up of text.

22
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,304
The layout of a Web page as seen by the user,

23
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:15,060
is put together by the web browser based on the code in that text file.

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,340
When a Web page includes an image or a video,

25
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,359
like the video you're watching right now,

26
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,325
it does that by including a text-based address in the code of the page.

27
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:27,924
The browser sees the address and then

28
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:31,849
downloads the right images or videos to put into that page.

29
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:35,794
When you load an HTML file into a programmer's text editor,

30
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:39,655
you'll often see it displayed with colors and special formatting,

31
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:42,493
this is called syntax highlighting,

32
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:45,174
and it's a special feature of that editor.

33
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:48,009
Those colors aren't saved in the file,

34
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,609
rather the editor knows the grammar of HTML and it applies

35
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,875
colors in order to help you get the grammar right as you're editing it.

36
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,635
When you save a file,

37
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,219
it's conventional to use a file name that has

38
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,924
a particular ending or extension indicating the files type.

39
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:10,375
This helps programs such as editors and browsers treat the file appropriately.

40
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:16,599
For HTML, we'll use filename endings and.HTML.
