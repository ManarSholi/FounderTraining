00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,669
The BR tag is great for adding line breaks in poems.

2
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:08,310
Not every webpage is a poem though,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,005
a lot of the time we're writing an article or a story or an essay or something like that.

4
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:18,155
These sorts of writings are usually split into paragraphs.

5
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:20,390
To make a paragraph in html,

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,990
we use the P element,

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,594
P stands for paragraph and it's a regular tag.

8
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:30,210
There's an opening P tag with an angle bracket P, angle bracket,

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,015
and then there's a closing P tag with an angle bracket slash P, angle bracket.

10
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:39,920
Let's make all of these paragraphs into P elements,

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,200
and now when we reload the page and the browser,

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,970
there we've got nice neat paragraphs now.

13
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,394
Each paragraph is separated from the next one by a little margin.

14
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:55,105
Whenever you're writing texts for a webpage in html,

15
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:59,194
you'll use P elements to mark up all of your paragraphs.

16
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:01,945
Why not just use line breaks?

17
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,760
It turns out later on that there are good reasons to

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,460
tell the browser about the structure of our text,

19
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:12,514
the little pieces it's made up of and not just what we want it to visually look like.

20
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:15,680
You'll learn more about this later when you learn to control

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,600
the visual appearance separately using CSS.
