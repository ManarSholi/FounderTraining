1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
Okay, keep your text editor and your browser handy.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,424
Let's try out a lot more HTML elements.

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:09,684
All the ones we're going to see now are typographic elements.

4
00:00:09,685 --> 00:00:13,620
They're used to say that the browser should display text in a different way.

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,524
Let's start out with a piece of ordinary text.

6
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:20,439
If we save this and load it up in the browser,

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,190
we see the text.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,635
Okay, big deal.

9
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:27,215
So, we could add some emphasis,

10
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:29,015
but we've done that before.

11
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:30,740
Let's try something else.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,829
Here's a different HTML element.

13
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,664
It's called Mark. "Hey Mark. What's up?"

14
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:39,079
Oh, it's not somebody named Mark.

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,089
It's for highlighting.

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,190
Loaded up in the browser and hey,

17
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:46,274
it's like someone ran a yellow highlighter over my life.

18
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:48,989
Let's try out some other elements.

19
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,760
Here are a couple to try.

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,179
Sub and sup.

21
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,429
I'm not going to show you what they look like,

22
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,479
because I want you to try them out for yourself.
