1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,450
Up ahead, you're going to learn about putting links and images into your web pages.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,960
But there's something that we have to cover on the way there: web addresses.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,714
The web wouldn't be the web without web addresses.

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,644
Every site, and page,

5
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:19,719
and image, and file on the web has one.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,774
They are how your browser follows links from one page to another,

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,579
and they are also a big part of how users tell

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,864
the browser to go to a website in the first place.

9
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:33,309
Whenever you put an image or a link in your html,

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,550
you'll do it using these addresses.

11
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,309
In the web standards,

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,440
there are technical terms for these addresses.

13
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,030
A web address is called a Uniform Resource Locator,

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,320
or URL for short.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,869
That just means that it's an address that tells

16
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:52,744
your browser how to locate a particular resource,

17
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:54,214
a file for instance,

18
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:56,205
in a standardized way.

19
00:00:56,204 --> 00:01:00,445
The word uniform here just means that it's consistent.

20
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,000
There are lots of different ways that URLs

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,415
are written when people are going to read them.

22
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:10,844
Like sometimes you'll see them with http or https on the front,

23
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,215
and sometimes you won't.

24
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:13,605
Like on the side of a truck,

25
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:18,734
someone might put www.ourcompany.com.

26
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,799
That works fine if you type it into a browser,

27
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,179
because the browser guesses that you want to go to a website.

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,720
But if you use that in HTML code, it won't work.

29
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,765
The browser thinks that you're referring to a file with that name.

30
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:37,730
When we write URLs in html we need to be

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,570
pretty careful to give the browser all the information that it needs.

32
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,684
You can in fact, sometimes take shortcuts.

33
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:48,545
But for now, we'll spell out URLs in their full form.

34
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:54,890
The version we're talking about is called a fully qualified URL or absolute URL.

35
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,609
You've probably seen it before as a web user,

36
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:01,295
but let's go over what that fully qualified form looks like.

37
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,355
There are a lot of other things that can appear in URLs,

38
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,520
but these are the basics.

39
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:13,310
At the beginning web URLs start with http or https.

40
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,235
This tells the browser whether to use secure encryption to connect to a web server.

41
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:23,955
The URL for a file that's on your local drive will start with "file" instead.

42
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:29,280
http, https, and file are all protocols,

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,305
or ways that the browser can get something.

44
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:36,355
After the protocol, we always see a colon, slash,

45
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:40,509
slash, what separates the protocol from the next part.

46
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,984
For web URLs, the next part that you'll see is a domain name.

47
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:48,235
This tells the browser what server to connect to.

48
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:52,675
File URLs won't have this because there is no server.

49
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:55,890
It's just the browser reading off of your own computer.

50
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,319
That's why if you give a file URL to someone else,

51
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,310
they probably won't be able to see it.

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,585
It's because the same file isn't on their computer.

53
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:08,659
The last thing that appears in a full URL is a file path,

54
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,204
the name of the directory,

55
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,770
and the file that the URL is referring to.

56
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,090
This will sometimes be empty or a single slash,

57
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,180
if you're linking to the top page or homepage of a site.
