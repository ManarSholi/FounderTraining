1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
So far the HTML that you've been writing in

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,110
this lesson has been what are called HTML fragments.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,265
They are snippets of HTML.

4
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:11,385
Which your browser can display,

5
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:16,550
but there are few more things to add to make them into a full HTML document,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,214
which is to say a web page.

7
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:24,824
The HTML you've written so far is like a few sentences out of the middle of a story.

8
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,425
But a published story usually has things like a title,

9
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,355
and an author on it, not just sentences.

10
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:34,509
Similarly, there are couple of things you'll need to

11
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:37,993
add to every HTML document to make it complete.

12
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:42,659
First, how does the browser know what kind of document it is?

13
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,699
The file name extension only tells part of that story.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,050
HTML has been around for many years,

15
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,274
and there have been a lot of different versions of HTML.

16
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:56,765
We indicate what kind of HTML we're using,

17
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,310
by putting a special tag at the very top of the file.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,050
This tag is the DOCTYPE tag.

19
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:06,114
It's written a little differently from other tags.

20
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:08,640
In earlier versions of HTML,

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,849
these DOCTYPE tags became very long and convoluted.

22
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,109
Eventually, the engineers who design

23
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:19,465
HTML decided to simplify them down to the very basics.

24
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:24,840
In modern HTML, the DOCTYPE tag looks just like this.

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:33,975
<!DOCTYPE html>. Just like that.

26
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:36,454
You'll put this, exactly this,

27
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:39,519
at the top of every HTML document you write.

28
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,530
Now what does the DOCTYPE tag do?

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,909
It tells the browser that we're intending this document to be treated as modern HTML,

30
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,629
as opposed to one of those older versions.

31
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,500
This isn't a very big deal for simple HTML but it

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,534
prevents a lot of bugs when your HTML gets more complex.

33
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,759
Without the DOCTYPE tag,

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,240
browsers will go into what's called quirks mode.

35
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,379
Which is trying to be more compatible with older forms of HTML.

36
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,379
That's generally not something we want today.

37
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:15,680
So, putting the DOCTYPE tag on your documents is the right way to go.
