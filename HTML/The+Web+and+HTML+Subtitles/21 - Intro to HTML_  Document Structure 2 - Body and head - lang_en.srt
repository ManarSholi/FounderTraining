1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,099
A full HTML document actually has two parts.

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,269
Everything you've seen so far in this lesson except the Doctype Tag,

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,044
actually lives in the second of these parts,

4
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:13,884
the body of the document,

5
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:16,464
that's where the contents of the document go,

6
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:19,239
the paragraphs, images, lists,

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:22,820
links and other things that will appear on the screen for the user.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,390
The other part of an HTML document is called the head and it's

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,905
where we put certain pieces of important information about the document.

10
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:37,984
Both the head and the body occur inside a single enclosing element called HTML.

11
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:42,840
Here's just a few of the things that can appear in the head of an HTML file.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,920
The title is the only required part of the head.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,030
It tells the browser what titled to put on a tab that's displaying the document.

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,960
We put the title in a title element with an open and a close tag.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,560
Another thing that shows up in the head is style sheet information.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,189
You'll learn a lot more about this later on.

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:10,129
Style sheets tell the browser things like what fonts and colors to use on the page,

18
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,329
and how to position the text.

19
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,075
The head can also contain scripts which are programs that run in the browser.

20
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,844
This is how front-end web apps work,

21
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:24,280
like the quizzes you've seen in this course for instance.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,743
The head can also include metadata which is other information

23
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:33,290
about the page itself such as keywords for search engines.

24
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,530
There's also information that can go on the HTML tag itself, for instance,

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,820
this is where you can say what language your document is written in,

26
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,359
not the computer language, that's HTML,

27
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,930
but the human language such as English or French or Tibetan or Swahili.

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,460
This is helpful for programs that try to understand or pronounce

29
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:00,839
the contents of that document such as screen readers for visually impaired users.

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:09,110
Should the word CHAT be pronounced as 'chat' in English or as 'sha' in French?

31
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,770
For now, the only element of the head that you need to use is

32
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,375
the title tag because it's required in HTML documents.

33
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,599
The others you will use later as you learn more about the web.
