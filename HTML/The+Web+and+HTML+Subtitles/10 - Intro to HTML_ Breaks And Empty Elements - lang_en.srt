00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,595
Let's talk about whitespace for a moment.

2
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:07,200
You may have noticed that when you enter text in the editor,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,509
you can put in multiple lines,

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,679
or spaces, or paragraph breaks.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,359
But when you render it in the browser,

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,219
it's all run together.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,844
This is because when the browser renders HTML,

8
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:22,925
all whitespace gets collapsed into a single space.

9
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:27,705
Now whitespace is a word that programmers use to talk about spaces,

10
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:30,119
tabs and line breaks.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,689
The browser by default runs all the whitespace together,

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,189
so we don't see the line breaks that we put in.

13
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:41,109
I want this poem to show up with separate lines.

14
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,549
Now there's a way I can do that in HTML.

15
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:48,405
Which is to put a particular tag on each line, called BR.

16
00:00:48,405 --> 00:00:50,725
BR stands for break.

17
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:52,179
As in line break.

18
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,664
Start a new line.

19
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:56,619
When we reload the browser window,

20
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:59,820
there, the poem shows up correctly.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,924
Now, you might notice that there's no closing tag for the BR element.

22
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:09,064
That's because it doesn't have any contents.

23
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:11,579
There's nothing inside a line break.

24
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,099
It's just saying, break the line here.

25
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:19,184
We'll see a few more HTML elements like this later on.

26
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:21,620
One's that don't have a closing tag at all,

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,905
because they don't have any contents.

28
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:28,614
Elements like this are called void elements, or empty elements.

29
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:33,109
One other example of these is the IMG tag for images.

30
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,040
We'll see that later for now,

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,180
let's stick with text.
