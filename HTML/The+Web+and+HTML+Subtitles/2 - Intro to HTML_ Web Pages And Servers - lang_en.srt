1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
Most of the time your browser gets

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,675
web pages by communicating with servers over the Internet.

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,294
Servers are just computers,

4
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:12,884
they're not fundamentally different from the one you're using right now,

5
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:18,134
but they have programs running on them that answer a browser's requests.

6
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:22,685
Your computer is probably connected to Udacity's webserver right now,

7
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:25,004
as well as, to other web servers.

8
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:28,509
One of the superpowers of the web is that you can make links to

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,340
a file or document that's on a different server for instance,

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,140
Udacity's website tells your browser to show

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,045
this video which is hosted on YouTube's website.

12
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:43,195
A web page can include resources such as videos, images,

13
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:48,549
fonts or program code from the same web server or from other web servers.

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,954
Web browsers and servers interact in a pretty specific way,

15
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:55,884
when you go to a web page or follow a link,

16
00:00:55,884 --> 00:01:01,964
your browser makes a request to the server asking for a particular document by name,

17
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:06,609
and the server sends a response back to the browser containing that document,

18
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:11,224
or if it can't find that document it sends an error message instead.

19
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:15,329
The rules for how these requests and responses work are

20
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,789
called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP.

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,205
That's why web addresses usually start with HTTP or HTTPS.

22
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:28,209
It's telling the browser how to talk to the server.

23
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:31,640
But when you're building a web page for the first time,

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,745
you won't need to run a server or have any HTTP involved.

25
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:38,930
Instead, you will just save the web page as a file

26
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,470
on your computer and open it up in your browser.

27
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,174
Your browser can display documents that are stored on your computer,

28
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,319
as well as, ones from the Internet.

29
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,379
Later when you want to publish a web page to the rest of

30
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,920
the world you will do that by putting it onto a server.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,739
So, what goes into a web page?

32
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,789
HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,950
the language that we use to provide the structure and the text of web pages.

34
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,550
When you load up a website in your browser,

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,650
the first thing that that server sends to your browser is a piece of HTML.

36
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,890
If you look at that HTML file using programmer's tools,

37
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,479
you will see all the technical details that tell the browser what to do.

38
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,159
When you open that same file in a web browser,

39
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,240
the browser will follow those instructions to build and display the page.
