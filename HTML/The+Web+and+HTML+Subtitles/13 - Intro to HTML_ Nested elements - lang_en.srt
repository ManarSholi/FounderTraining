00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,115
Next up, we're going to talk about an important concept called Nesting.

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,820
By Nesting, I just mean the idea that something can go

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,820
inside or be nested inside something else.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,790
Here's a hands-on example.

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,259
Have you ever seen one of these Russian Matryoshka dolls,

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,955
you can open up the first one,

7
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:20,719
and there's another one inside.

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,704
And inside there, there's another one.

9
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:27,479
If you open them up, and look at them from the top,

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,385
you can see how they all fit together.

11
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:31,135
And to neatly close them up,

12
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:34,054
you have to put them back in the right order.

13
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:37,789
Anyway, HTML elements are like that.

14
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,214
Elements on an HTML page can go inside other elements,

15
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:45,535
but they have to follow some certain rules when they do.

16
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:52,449
For example, you can have a paragraph element that has em or mark elements inside it.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,225
In fact, that's how HTML documents normally work.

18
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,939
The top level elements in the document are

19
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,989
things like paragraphs and other big divisions,

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,000
and inside those, are smaller elements like,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,439
"Emphasize this text," Or "Highlight that text."

22
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,480
Any of these smaller elements,

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,140
can be put inside another one too.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,594
For instance, you can have text that's both emphasized and highlighted,

25
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:23,784
or you can have things like superscripts show up inside of a piece of emphasized text.

26
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,899
But there are some combinations that don't work,

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,830
you can't put a paragraph inside another paragraph for instance,

28
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,539
and two different HTML elements,

29
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,910
can't overlap in the text.

30
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,729
One has to be entirely inside the other.

31
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,810
Either the sup needs to be inside the em,

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,305
or the em inside the sup.

33
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,590
These rules are mostly common sense,

34
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,600
but we'll point them out when there are unusually specific requirements.

35
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,189
Either element can be the little doll,

36
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,194
that goes inside the bigger one,

37
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:04,959
but you have to decide which one will go inside, they can't overlap.
