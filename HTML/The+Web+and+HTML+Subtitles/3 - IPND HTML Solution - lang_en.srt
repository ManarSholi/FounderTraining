1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,730
Let's take a look at the five statements on this quiz.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,130
Number one was, when you type you udacity.com into your browser,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,100
your browser communicates with Udacity's server using HTTP.

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,695
Well, that's true.

5
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:17,609
There were a bunch of things involved in getting a web page to your browser.

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,910
But one of them is that your browser communicates with a server using HTTP.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,894
The browser sends a request for the page and the server responds.

8
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:28,995
What's in that response is number two,

9
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,380
a piece of html.

10
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,810
So, number two is true.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,810
Number three says that your browser has to copy

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,250
all of the files from the web server. That's not true.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,409
The browser only fetches a copy of the particular files or

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:46,250
resources that the page needs and that's what number four says.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,990
So, number four is true.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,635
Your browser requests other files from our server and other web servers.

17
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:57,649
Number five says that everything on Udacity's website has to come from Udacity's server.

18
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:00,710
That's not true. Web pages can include or

19
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,774
refer to files located on other servers as well.

20
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:06,650
For instance, this video isn't hosted on

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,280
the same server that provided the html around it.
