00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,504
So, you've just seen how to get plain text displayed in your browser,

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:08,449
but HTML can do a lot more than that.

3
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:13,125
An HTML file contains markup to tell the browser exactly what to do.

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:17,079
Markup is just text that has a special meaning.

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:21,279
In HTML, most of the markup looks like this.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,120
It has these less than and greater than signs that set

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,375
off the name of a keyword such as strong.

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:31,844
This word strong inside these symbols is a tag,

9
00:00:31,844 --> 00:00:38,280
and this whole unit with two matching tags and some text in between is called an element.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,505
Here's another example of an element.

11
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,800
This one is called an em element,

12
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,034
an em stands for emphasis.

13
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:48,125
It means that the text inside should be emphasized.

14
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,200
Usually that means it's displayed in italics.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,315
Whatever contents are inside the element like,

16
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:58,164
hi there, will be displayed that way in the browser.

17
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:01,954
Now, every element starts and ends with a tag.

18
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:05,194
The one at the beginning has a less-than sign,

19
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:07,309
em, and then a greater-than sign,

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,275
and at the end of the element there's a tag with a less-than sign,

21
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:14,335
slash, em, and a greater-than sign.

22
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:18,429
The difference between these two tags is the slash in this one.

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,405
The way HTML works,

24
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:24,185
this first tag is called an opening tag or starts tag,

25
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:28,549
and the one with the slash is a closing tag or end tag,

26
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,515
these often come in pairs like this, but not always.

27
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:38,950
The HTML tags always start with the less-than sign and end with the greater-than sign.

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,850
Web programmers usually call

29
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:44,569
these angle brackets because they're shaped like a sharp angle.

30
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,419
The angle brackets always come in pairs,

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,129
it's an error to start a tag with

32
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:53,769
an open angle bracket and not ever write a closed bracket to finish the tag.

33
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:57,619
This idea of opening and closing is going to keep coming

34
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,790
up as you learn HTML and in other computer languages too.

35
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,190
It's not all that different from what we do in

36
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,655
arithmetic with parentheses or round brackets.

37
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:12,890
You wouldn't ever have a closed parenthesis on its own without an open one first,

38
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,099
same goes for HTML tags.

39
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,169
Now, you might notice that I call this whole thing an element,

40
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,954
and I call these start and end parts tags.

41
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,800
That's technically correct.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,450
However human beings aren't always as precise as computers are,

43
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,969
and so you'll often hear us talk about this whole thing as a tag.

44
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,780
That's a little bit wrong,

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,455
but you'll generally be able to tell from context,

46
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:42,330
whether we're talking about a single opening or closing tag,

47
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,080
or a whole element
