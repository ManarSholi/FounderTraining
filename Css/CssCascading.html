<!--
    The term "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets refers to the way that style properties "cascade" down the DOM tree, 
    starting at the top. A style applied to the body element will affect the entire document. A style applied to a 
    lower-level element will affect that element and all its descendants.
    
    A style applied at a lower level can override a style at a higher level. 
    For instance, if the body has color: red but a paragraph within the body has color: blue, 
    the blue will apply to that paragraph and to any elements inside it:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>
            cascading
        </title>
        <style>
            body { color: red; }
            p { color: blue; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> This will be blue, not red. <br>
        <em> Same with this. </em> </p>
    </body>
</html>
