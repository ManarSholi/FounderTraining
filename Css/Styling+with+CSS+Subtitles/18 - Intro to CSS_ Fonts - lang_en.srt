1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,774
Okay. Let's talk about fonts.

2
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:05,160
One of the things that can really make a website more

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,675
distinctive is to choose fonts that work well together.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:14,515
CSS lets you change all sorts of things about the font in which your text gets displayed.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,370
Now, fonts are actually really complicated and there's

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,785
a whole history of topography that we are totally not getting into in this course.

7
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:25,850
We'll just touch the basics that every CSS user will need.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,740
If you're used to working with fonts in a word processor,

9
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:34,369
what you think of as a font CSS actually calls a font-family.

10
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:40,390
This is the name of a typeface like Times New Roman or Helvetica or Impact.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,399
Applying a font-family rule to

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,085
an element will make text in that element show up in that font.

13
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:51,070
Well, it'll try to anyway.

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,924
Not every computer or device has the same fonts installed.

15
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:59,099
If you ask for a font family and the user's device doesn't have it,

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,045
CSS just won't do anything.

17
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:04,310
It will just leave the text and the default font-family which

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,995
is usually something boring but inoffensive like Times.

19
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:11,150
If you don't care exactly what font-family the user

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,275
sees but you know that you want it to be a particular sort of font,

21
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,955
CSS offers generic font families for these.

22
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:23,810
There are five of these and they're named for five general categories of fonts;

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,430
Serif, Sans-Serif, Cursive, Fantasy and Monospace.

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,110
You can say font-family: monospace,

25
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:38,260
and be sure that you're getting some monospace font.

26
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,240
When you don't care whether it turns out to be Courier New or income's Inconsolata.

27
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,250
But usually we use generic fonts as a fallback plan

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,094
in case the browser doesn't have access to a particular font that we do want.

29
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:57,310
Because of that, CSS lets us write a font stack.

30
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,579
A list of font families usually ending with the generic.

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,189
So for instance, Windows has this really nice font

32
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,629
called Constantia but it's only available on Windows.

33
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,349
We might say okay,

34
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,185
there are other similar fonts on other platforms like

35
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:18,180
Georgia and then if we don't have that we'll settle for any Serif font.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,165
There are other things we can control about the font besides the typeface though.

37
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:27,155
There's the font size which is how big the text is.

38
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:32,349
Usually, we measure this in points but CSS lets you use whatever unit you want.

39
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:38,069
You can say I want a font size of one inch which is the same as 72 points.

40
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,275
Other things you might want to control about the font like bold or italic or

41
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:48,939
underline actually work kind of differently in CSS than they do in a word processor.

42
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,794
Like in Google Docs,

43
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:56,549
bold and italic and underline are all just buttons right next to each other but in CSS,

44
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,045
these are all controlled by different properties.

45
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:04,574
Bold is font-weight: bold and italic is

46
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:13,789
font-style: italic and underline is actually text-decoration: underline.

47
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:17,370
Fortunately, you don't ever need to actually use those.

48
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,090
You can specify everything about the font you want in a single line.

49
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,770
There's a property called font that

50
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,980
lets you combine all of these properties into a single line.

51
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,935
So instead of writing all of these different properties,

52
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,694
you can just write this.

53
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:35,709
Unfortunately, you do have to write those parts in

54
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,180
a specific order which I always have to look up.

55
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,439
So, I'm just going to suggest you look it up too.
