00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Pretty often in CSS,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,240
we don't want to say make this box exactly 200 pixels wide.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,234
We want to say something more like,

4
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:11,719
make this box take up half of the page width,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,820
but we don't know how wide the user's browser window is.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,410
So, we can't just say a number of pixels,

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,464
or EMs, or something for this.

8
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:22,670
What we can do is use a percentage.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,810
When we set the width or the height of a box to be a percentage like 50 percent,

10
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:30,829
we're asking the browser to make it that fraction of

11
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,079
the width or height of the box that it's inside.

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,859
For boxes at the top level of our document,

13
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:39,945
that makes it 50 percent of the width the whole page.

14
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:43,000
For a box that's inside another box,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,354
it's 50 percent of the width of its parent box.

16
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:48,344
But here's something to watch out for.

17
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:53,239
By default, width doesn't include the border and it never includes the padding.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,039
So, if you have two boxes that you want to fit next to each other using float: left,

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,700
you will usually need to make them smaller than 50 percent of the containing box.

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,725
CSS also uses percentages for something pretty different,

21
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:09,034
scaling things up or down.

22
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:14,289
For instance, let's say that we want to make strong text even stronger than usual.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,445
We can do that by defining a style on the strong element to make the font-size,

24
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:23,634
say, 120 percent, and maybe we'll make the color red.

25
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:28,734
That means that no matter what the actual font-size in points is of the text,

26
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:32,359
any text that's in a strong element will be expanded to

27
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:37,000
120 percent of the strong node's parent font-size.
