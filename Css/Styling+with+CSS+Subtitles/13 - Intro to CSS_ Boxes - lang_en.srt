00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,634
So, you've seen before that when the browser renders html,

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:09,660
every element has an invisible box around it, well usually invisible.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,900
These are the boxes that you've seen when you're looking around pages in developer tools.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,585
There are a whole bunch of things that we can set about any of these boxes using CSS.

5
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:25,875
There's the width, the height of the box, there's the padding,

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,420
which is the space around the contents of the box,

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,925
outside the padding is the box's border,

8
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:32,730
which is usually invisible,

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,128
but you can turn it on with CSS.

10
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:36,799
Then, there's the margin,

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,384
which is a space that the browser makes between this box, and other boxes.

12
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,839
Each of these is something that you can set a value measured

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,530
in CSS units such as pixels or m's.

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,240
Let's take a look at this with a couple of fancy little boxes and a big ole webpage.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,100
Let's try configuring some of these properties for these boxes.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,530
We'll start out by setting a border, border five pixels.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,289
To make the border visible,

18
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:06,025
we'll also say we'll make it solid green.

19
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,980
That's something that you can do with borders, and hey,

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,049
now our boxes have green borders around them,

21
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,739
but right now these boxes are jammed up into each other,

22
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,089
and that's kind of ugly.

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,439
How far apart should we space them?

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,644
Well, how about one M that's the same as the height of this text the inside them.

25
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:28,405
So, let's do that, margin: 1em.

26
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:33,700
The thing is the text inside these boxes is crowded up against those borders,

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,064
we can fix that by adding padding.

28
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:39,274
Let's make the padding a little bit smaller than the margin,

29
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:45,750
maybe half an m, padding: 0.5em.

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,974
There we go, now the text is a little bit more comfortable in the boxes.

31
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:54,229
Notice that the padding is space inside the boxes borders,

32
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,424
whereas the margin is space outside the border.

33
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:02,479
Finally, right now these boxes are the full width of the page,

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,585
that's how block elements usually start out by default.

35
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,340
Let's make them a little bit smaller than that.

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,719
Let's say width: 100px, and height: 50px.

37
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,289
Ah, there we go.

38
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,625
That's looking more like something that we could use on a web page.

39
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,840
Okay. One more thing,

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,050
let's get these boxes to move out of the way.

41
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,120
We can do this by telling CSS to make them float right,

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,360
which makes the browser tries to set them at the right side of the page.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,535
Float is one of the many ways that we can change the positioning of the box using CSS.

44
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:44,359
You'll learn a couple more ways later in the lesson.
