1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
One way that we can apply style to

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,770
a webpage is to visit each node of the tree and add the style we want.

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:13,454
There's a style attribute that we can put on html opening tags to do just that.

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:18,730
For instance, if we'd like to turn all of these list items green, we could do that.

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,504
We can add the style attribute,

6
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:22,699
style equals color, colon,

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,464
green, to each of the li elements.

8
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:29,704
The problem with doing it this way is that it's incredibly repetitious.

9
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:31,784
Also, if we mess up in one place,

10
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:33,304
it'll be hard to catch.

11
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:39,350
Generally in computing, if it's possible to avoid repeating yourself it's nice to do so,

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,980
not only does it save on typing but it also makes for fewer places things can go wrong.

13
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:50,449
So, what CSS lets us do is to pull all of the style information out,

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,850
and say we want to apply this style to

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,679
every li in the document instead of just one at a time.

16
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,189
One way we can do that is by putting a CSS rule set into

17
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:06,310
the document's head element by creating a special element called style.

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,115
The style information that we put here will be applied throughout the document.

19
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:15,094
As the browser builds up the picture on screen from the dom tree,

20
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:17,814
it'll use these style rules to color,

21
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:20,359
shape, and layout the page.
