00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,384
So, you've seen now how the browser turns HTML text into the tree structure of the DOM.

2
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:09,300
Let's take a look at how it can turn

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,135
that tree structure into a picture that we can see on the screen.

4
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm going to load up one of our sample HTML pages,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,589
and check it out using developer tools to see what I can find.

6
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:25,019
I have a sense of how the HTML of the page has a tree structure,

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,500
but how does that relate to what is on the page?

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,755
So, it looks like this OL element gets rendered as a large box,

9
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:40,505
and each of these LI elements shows up as a smaller box inside it.

10
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:44,045
The large box fills up the whole width of the page,

11
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,410
while the smaller ones,

12
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:48,579
each look like they take up about a fifth of the page.

13
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,399
Over here, in the Style pane of the developer tools,

14
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,494
we can see this same sort of box diagram.

15
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:59,155
Here, it's got some parts labeled margin,

16
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:01,310
and border, and padding.

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,780
This margin here might have something to do with the CSS code

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,310
here that says, margin 20px.

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,920
So, we saw earlier that the browser reads the text of the HTML document,

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,579
and turns it into a tree structure.

21
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,875
We had the question of how it gets from there

22
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,260
into the two dimensional layout of a web page on the screen.

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,340
Well, these boxes are pretty much the answer to that.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,064
Every element that appears on the page gets laid out into a box,

25
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:37,700
and these boxes land inside of other boxes.

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,545
The layout of these boxes, well,

27
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:45,320
it's controlled by the tree structure with a little help from the CSS.

28
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:48,529
So, for instance, the HTML code for

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,109
this list will always get translated into the same tree structure,

30
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:57,090
and that tree structure will always be turned into boxes.

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,865
One big box containing three smaller boxes.

32
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:05,694
But then, whether those boxes get laid out like this, vertically,

33
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:08,314
or like this, horizontally,

34
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:13,359
and pink, is something that you can control with the CSS.
