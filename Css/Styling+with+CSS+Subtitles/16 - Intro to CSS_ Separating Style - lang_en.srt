1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
There are a few different ways that we can tell

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,330
the browser to apply CSS styles to our HTML.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,304
One of them you've seen already.

4
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:11,129
We can just take the CSS code and put it into

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,440
the HTML documents head in the style element.

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,759
But this can turn out to be messy.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,670
It's really common for a website to have many,

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,005
many HTML documents, and to want to apply the same styles to all of them.

9
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:30,599
Copying the same CSS code to each of those pages would be a big waste of space.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,300
If we wanted to make a change to it,

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,820
we'd have to change all of those files.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,310
So, there's another way we can do it.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,455
We can put the CSS into a separate file,

14
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:43,320
and link to that file from the HTML.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,365
The way we do this is to put a special tag into the HTML head link rel equals stylesheet,

16
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:56,855
href equals, and then the URL or the file name of the CSS file.

17
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:59,689
Remember the rules for relative URLs?

18
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:03,439
If we're using a CSS file that's somewhere else on the web,

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,635
we'll put a full URL in here.

20
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:09,880
But if the CSS file is in the same directory as our HTML,

21
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,584
and it's called say,

22
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:16,030
style.css, then we can just put that file name here.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,489
This link element goes inside the head element of the HTML file.

24
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:25,194
We can put it right after the title element for instance.

25
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:28,349
When the browser loads this HTML file,

26
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,109
it will automatically load up

27
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:35,159
styles.css and apply those styles to the elements in this file.
