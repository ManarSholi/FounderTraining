00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,504
One of the things we can use CSS for is to change the layout of elements on the page.

2
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:10,179
This means, we can move them around, change their sizes,

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,439
reshape them, and change the way they get positioned around each other.

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,660
In order to talk about where those elements are on the page,

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,074
we need to have units of measurement.

6
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:22,839
Just as in everyday life,

7
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,134
we might use meters or feet,

8
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:30,040
or miles or kilometers to say where something is or how big it is,

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,954
in CSS, we have some various units that we use.

10
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:37,884
The basic unit of measurement in CSS is the pixel,

11
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:39,614
or px for short.

12
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:42,410
Pixels are the unit that you'll see developer tools

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,824
using to measure the size of a box element.

14
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:50,719
Now, normally, a pixel is a single dot of color on your screen.

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,464
But computer screens don't all have the same size pixels.

16
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:57,680
In particular, the actual hardware pixels on

17
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,644
new mobile devices are really tiny compared to the pixels on older computer screens.

18
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:10,725
In CSS, the unit called pixel or px Isn't really a hardware pixel.

19
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:15,234
Instead, it's defined as being one-ninety sixth of an inch.

20
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,209
Ninety-six pixels per inch was

21
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:21,284
a common screen resolution when CSS was being standardized.

22
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:24,984
So, that's what the CSS px unit was set to.

23
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,500
Yeah, sorry metric fans,

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,159
CSS measurement is defined in terms of traditional American units,

25
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,200
there are 96 CSS pixels to the inch,

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,900
which means there are 37.8 CSS pixels to the centimeter.

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,565
Here's an example of how we can use these units.

28
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:46,414
Let's say that we have a p element with class skinny,

29
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:49,895
and we want to make it appear two inches wide on the screen.

30
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:55,099
The CSS property width sets how wide and element will appear.

31
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,544
To select the element,

32
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:59,725
we'll use the class selector.skinny,

33
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:06,009
and then we'll add a declaration width: 192 px;,

34
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,064
and when that's applied to this html,

35
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:12,689
we get a skinny paragraph, two inches wide.

36
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,189
Remember, the class name skinny is just something we

37
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:19,704
made up in order to attach this rule set to that paragraph.

38
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,105
We could have named it Aardvark instead,

39
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:24,963
but that wouldn't be very descriptive.

40
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:28,004
There are other units in CSS too.

41
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:32,044
One traditional typographic unit is the point, or pt.

42
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:36,004
You've probably seen this on word processors like MS Word,

43
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:39,344
or Google Docs, where you can have a 12 point font,

44
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,965
or a 36 point font, or the like.

45
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:45,469
A point is just one-seventy second of an inch.

46
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,025
In CSS, points aren't only for font size,

47
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:51,370
but that's where they're most common.

48
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,879
Some units were pretty differently though.

49
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,719
Whereas px and points are based on inches,

50
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,159
which is a real-world measure of length,

51
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:05,995
other CSS units are relative to the size of something else on the page.

52
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,379
One of these is the em,

53
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,275
and em is equal to the font size of the text in the element.

54
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:16,069
So, if you're using an 18 point font,

55
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,560
then 1em is 18 points
