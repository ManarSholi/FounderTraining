1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
You don't always want to style

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,730
all elements of the same type in exactly the same way though.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,570
For instance, if your document is an article with a sidebar,

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,195
you might want to apply a different style to

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:15,315
paragraph elements in the article versus in the sidebar.

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:18,359
One way you can do this is by putting a special attribute on

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,864
the HTML tags, the class attribute.

8
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:24,659
In computer languages, class is

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,375
a really common word for a group of things with the same characteristics.

10
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,234
As you go on in computing,

11
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:36,899
you'll see lots of other examples of classes in different languages.

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,820
But for now here,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,350
a class in html is just a special attribute that we can use to say that,

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,060
for instance, some paragraphs need to have different style than other paragraphs.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,344
So, how do you create a class?

16
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,469
All you have to do is make up a name for that class and start using it.

17
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,159
You add the class attribute to

18
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,839
some html elements and create a CSS rule set with the same name,

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,240
and the way you apply a CSS rule set to

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,589
a class is to write a selector that starts with the dot.

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,260
Classes are what you should use when there can be

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,990
several elements on the page that you want to apply a rule to.

23
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:19,269
If you know there will be only one element to apply it to,

24
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:24,069
you can make this clearer by using the id attribute instead of class.

25
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:29,469
The difference between id and class is that id is meant to be unique.

26
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:33,724
There can only be one element with a particular id on the page.

27
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:38,394
In contrast, there can be any number of elements with the same class.

28
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:43,439
Id values come from the same place that class values do, you just make them up.

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,834
But to apply a style to elements by id instead of a dot in the selector,

30
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,754
you put a hash mark,

31
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:52,429
or a number sign,

32
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,880
or one of these things anyway.
