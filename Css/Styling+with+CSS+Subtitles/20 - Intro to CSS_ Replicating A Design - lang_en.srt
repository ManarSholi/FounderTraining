00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
You've learned a lot of CSS techniques so far in this lesson.

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,289
Now, it's time to put a bunch of them together at once.

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,799
In the next exercise,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,235
you'll be doing something that web developers do pretty often.

5
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,939
Making a web page match a design,

6
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,969
by adding CSS to it.

7
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,285
The design you'll be working with looks like this.

8
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,250
It's a tic-tac-toe board.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,414
All of these x's and o's are just ordinary text.

10
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:29,649
But they're in a big size,

11
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:31,579
and a particular font.

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,414
They're on a background,

13
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:36,774
and they neatly space in their own little squares.

14
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,909
You'll start out with a piece of plain HTML,

15
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,859
and an empty CSS file.

16
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,344
Your job will be to fill in that CSS file.

17
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,109
Here's how I suggest you do it.

18
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,505
One step at a time.

19
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,409
Here's another suggestion.

20
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:55,384
Start by getting the boxes laid out in the way that you want them.

21
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:58,479
Then, work on the fonts and colors after that.

22
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,634
If you're completely lost,

23
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:03,004
that's okay too. Give it a try.

24
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:06,480
See what sorts of things you can do by using just CSS,

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,855
to make this layout.

26
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:12,730
On the next page, will each show you how we approach this problem.
