00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
There's something special built right into your web browser that will be

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,890
an incredibly huge help for learning more about HTML and CSS.

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,320
It's called the "Developer tools," and it's

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,390
something that every web developer spends a lot of time with.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,980
When you get started with it,

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,705
it can seem a little overwhelming but it's also really valuable.

7
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:22,169
Every browser has a developer tools window built in,

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,215
but it'll look a bit different from one browser to another.

9
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,460
I'm demonstrating this using Google Chrome,

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,170
but you can use whatever browser you're already using.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,920
They have pretty similar abilities,

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,010
although some of their names for things might be a little bit different.

13
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,434
Here, I've got the webpage for the World Wide Web Consortium,

14
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:44,145
and if I right-click or control-click on this page there's this option inspect,

15
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,045
this is one way to get at the developer tools.

16
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,225
Well, what are we inspecting?

17
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:53,660
This lets me look at the HTML elements for everything on this page,

18
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,159
starting out with what I clicked on.

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,234
So, like I said, there's a lot going on here.

20
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:05,069
Each of these tabs lets you peek into a different aspect of what the browser is doing.

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,819
For now, we'll stick to this elements tab which shows you some HTML elements.

22
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:14,779
This looks a lot like the HTML source code for this page.

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,875
As I mouse over these HTML elements,

24
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,079
it highlights the parts of the page that correspond to them.

25
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,459
This element's view and the rendered page over

26
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:29,734
on the left are two different views of the same underlying data.

27
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,795
But since we're doing CSS,

28
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:35,445
it's this part down here which is actually really interesting.

29
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:38,509
If I click on one of these elements down,

30
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,330
here I can see a bunch of information about the style of that element. Check it out.

31
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,069
It tells you about the background,

32
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:48,244
and the border, and the padding,

33
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:50,359
and the font, and color,

34
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,974
a whole bunch of things that have to do with a style and appearance of the page.

35
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:57,334
There's a pretty useful trick with this style pane over here.

36
00:01:57,334 --> 00:02:02,434
Each of these pieces of style information has a little checkbox next to it.

37
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:07,519
Clicking them can turn that style on or off and that means that we can use this as

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,769
a tool to find out what the style settings

39
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,680
do by looking at the effects on the rendered page,

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,435
like check it out.

41
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:20,000
Turning this padding setting on or off changes the padding on the page.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
This is something we should do a lot when we have a new tool.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,609
Find out how we can use it to investigate

44
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:30,090
the world and see what we can discover about what we can change with it.
