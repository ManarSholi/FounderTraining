00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,669
There are a lot of things you can do with CSS.

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:09,599
So much so, that probably one of the most important things we can teach you about CSS,

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,834
is how to find out more about what it can do.

4
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:16,594
So that's what we're going to do in this next exercise.

5
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:20,369
We'll give you a link to some reference material about CSS,

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,865
and you'll look up some properties in it.

7
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:25,169
This way you'll get used to using some of

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,550
the reference material that serious web developers use all day,

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,359
and we don't have to make ten zillion videos for all of the different features.

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,854
It's okay if the reference material looks a little overwhelming or a lot overwhelming;

11
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:42,369
this is like looking up a word in the dictionary.

12
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,909
When you're not quite sure how the word is spelled,

13
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,839
it may take you several tries searching through

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,070
it or you may end up using your favorite search engine.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,399
That's a totally valid way of learning more too.
