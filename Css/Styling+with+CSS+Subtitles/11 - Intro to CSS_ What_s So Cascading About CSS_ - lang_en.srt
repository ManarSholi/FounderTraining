00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,405
Okay. So, you've seen a bunch of things that you can do with CSS,

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,860
but here's a question we haven't answered yet,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,095
what's so cascading about cascading style sheets?

4
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:17,554
Well, cascading has to do with how each node in the dom tree gets its styles defined.

5
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:21,420
Basically, any style property defined on a node will

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,455
apply as a default to all that nodes descendants.

7
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:29,864
Let's say that we have a document whose body looks like this,

8
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:33,625
and we have CSS rules like this.

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,395
What we want to know is what color will each

10
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:41,035
of these text nodes become when it's displayed in the browser.

11
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:47,509
To find out, we'll walk through the dom tree visiting each node starting at the top.

12
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:50,390
If there's a CSS rule for that node,

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,384
we'll apply that style to it,

14
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:56,570
but each node will also inherit style from its parent node.

15
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,539
We start with the body node.

16
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,820
There's a rule for that.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,850
This rule says to make this white text on a black background.

18
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,250
Then we'll go down the left branch to h1,

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,155
we don't have a rule for h1 so it gets the same style as its parent.

20
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,349
Then we go to the text node "All about."

21
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:18,674
That gets the same style as its parent the h1.

22
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,299
Over to the em node here,

23
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,554
we have two different rules that might give this node its color.

24
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:30,075
We've got a rule for EM and another rule for h1 em.

25
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:33,765
In this case, the most specific selector applies.

26
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:36,549
Here, that's the h1 em rule.

27
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,884
So this gets to be orange not red,

28
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:43,335
but the h1 em rule doesn't define the background color,

29
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,974
so, that'll be inherited from above.

30
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:48,784
This text node that says CSS,

31
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:52,890
that'll also inherit the orange on black style from its parent.

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,034
Over to the right side of the tree,

33
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:58,359
the p node matches the CSS rule for p,

34
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,170
so, it gets pink,

35
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,405
p for pink paragraph.

36
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:06,530
Still inheriting the black background from the body though,

37
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,905
and those will cascade down to this text node but over here,

38
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:14,455
we've got an em node that will be painted red,

39
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:18,725
and that'll cascade down to the text node below. Awesome.

40
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:23,810
So, that's what so cascading about cascading style sheets.

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,099
Each style property that's defined on a node will cascade

42
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,509
or spill down the tree to that node's children and descendants.

43
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:37,459
The black background color in this example cascaded to every node on the tree,

44
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,840
but each of these text colors only cascaded within a particular sub-tree.
