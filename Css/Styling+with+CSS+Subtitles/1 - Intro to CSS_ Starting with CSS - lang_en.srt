00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
Welcome back. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,134
you're going to learn the basics of a very colorful part of the web.

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:09,765
It's called CSS or Cascading Style Sheets.

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:13,769
It's how webpages get all their decoration, all the colors,

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,964
fonts and layout that you see on the web are provided by CSS.

6
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:24,039
Using CSS, you'll be able to greatly improve the look of your HTML pages.

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,780
That can be anything from changing the color of

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,225
your text to completely changing the layout.

9
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:33,439
While you're learning about jazzing up your webpage,

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,354
you'll also be stretching your knowledge of computer language syntax.

11
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:41,119
You'll get a better understanding of how computer languages are put

12
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,759
together and that will serve you well throughout your introduction to programming.
