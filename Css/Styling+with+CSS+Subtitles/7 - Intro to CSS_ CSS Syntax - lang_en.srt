00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,084
A CSS rule-set is made up of two parts,

2
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:07,439
a selector and a declaration block.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,290
The selector is the part that says which

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,799
html element or elements the rule is going to work on.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,173
The declaration block says how the rule will modify those elements.

6
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:22,739
Here's that example from before,

7
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,464
a rule-set that turns all of the list items green.

8
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:29,085
The selector here is li,

9
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:35,160
and there's one entry in the declaration block; color, colon, green.

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,134
CSS rules are always written like this,

11
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:41,174
the selector comes first,

12
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,814
and then there are these curly braces around the declaration block.

13
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:48,809
Here are a couple of examples.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,679
In this example here,

15
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,750
the selector is p. This means that it will

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,634
apply to all paragraph elements in the document.

17
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:02,759
In this second one, the selector is.weird.

18
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:09,170
This means that it will apply to any element with the class attribute equal to weird.

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,835
We'll see more about the class attribute just ahead.

20
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:17,449
The part inside the curly braces is called the declaration block,

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,575
and it consists of one or more declarations, also called rules.

22
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:25,490
Each declaration tells the browser to make

23
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:29,354
one specific change to the style of the selected elements.

24
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:34,859
Like, here's a declaration, width: 50%.

25
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,829
This block has two declarations in it; color, colon,

26
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:44,000
purple, and font dash size colon larger.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,909
You've probably noticed by now that each of these entries has a descriptive name,

28
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,114
like width, or color, or font size.

29
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:55,890
That's called the property that the rule is affecting.

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,674
Then it has a colon,

31
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,754
and then, the value that's giving that property.

32
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:05,019
Then at the end of the rule there is always a semicolon.

33
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:07,810
For instance, in this rule here,

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,520
color is the property,

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,715
and purple is the value that's being given to that property.

36
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:19,170
So, the rule ends up being color, colon, purple, semicolon.

37
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:25,000
So, the syntax of CSS doesn't look anything like the syntax of html itself.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,125
But, that makes sense because they're really trying to accomplish different things.

39
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:35,719
A piece of html describes a tree structure made out of elements.

40
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,509
A CSS declaration says,

41
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,669
here's a particular kind of element,

42
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,879
and here's some styles to apply to it.
