00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,778
So, a CSS selector tells the browser which elements the rule will affect.

2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,259
There are a few different kinds of selectors that you can use.

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,119
Actually, there are a whole lot of them,

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,744
but we're just going to look at a few of them for now.

5
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:18,089
The simplest one is a type selector,

6
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:23,824
it's just the name of one type of HTML element such as p or em.

7
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,480
It can even be body,

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,324
which would make the rule apply to the whole body of the HTML document.

9
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:34,820
For an example, here's a rule-set that will change the font for the entire document.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,310
Type selectors are particularly useful when you want to

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,890
apply a style really widely across the web page.

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,649
For instance, if you're writing an article that uses a lot of section headings

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,269
with the headline elements h1 h2 and so on,

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:54,525
a single CSS selector will apply to all of the elements of a particular type,

15
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:59,539
but you still have to write one CSS rule for each headline element type.

16
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:03,888
This one targets every h1 element on the page and applies these styles.

17
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:08,329
This one targets every h2 element and applies these styles and so on.
