1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
So far in this course you've specified colors with words like red and purple.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,339
But, there are only so many words for colors and the web isn't a box of crayons.

3
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,269
You should be able to make any color that you want,

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,140
and indeed you can.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,535
Computer screens make all their colors by mixing the primary colors of red,

6
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:23,780
green, and blue light.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,640
That means that we can describe any color as

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,355
a mixture of particular amounts of red, green, and blue.

9
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:32,469
For each of the primary colors,

10
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,865
we can say how much of that color we want in the mix,

11
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:40,594
anywhere from zero to 100 percent of full brightness.

12
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:45,700
For instance, if we mix 100 percent red with 50 percent green,

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,995
we'll get this bright orange.

14
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:54,000
One way we can write this in CSS is as RGB 100 percent,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
50 percent, zero percent.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,770
If I apply this as the background color of the page body,

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,560
sure enough it turns orange.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,365
But, there are actually several different ways we can write colors in CSS.

19
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:12,689
You'll see all of these on real web pages out there in the wild.

20
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,439
Okay. These look really different.

21
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,289
What's going on with them?

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,700
To understand these last two,

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,594
you need to know a bit about how computers store

24
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:28,054
color information in web browsers and in most other applications.

25
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:33,600
Each of the primary colors can have 256 possible values.

26
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,709
This is because each color is stored in a single byte:

27
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:43,309
a space in memory that can hold a number from zero to 255.

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,525
We can write a byte value as a number from zero to 255,

29
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:54,205
but we can also write it as a number in hexadecimal or hex base 16.

30
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:58,189
In hex, each digit can go from zero to nine,

31
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:05,004
and then from A to F. Hex codes are definitely harder for most folks to figure out,

32
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:10,919
but they're traditional on the web and web designers like to joke around about them.

33
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,234
Like in this mug I found on Cafe Press.

34
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:16,555
All zeros is black and all F's is white.

35
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:20,224
So, it's saying, things aren't always black and white.

36
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,144
Here's another example.

37
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:28,605
The color with the hex code 02B3E4 is Udacity's blue.

38
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:32,649
That's the same as RGB 1 percent, 70 percent,

39
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,110
89 percent, or RGB 2, 179, 228.

40
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,660
Remember, although these look really different,

41
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,240
all three of them are just ways of saying how much red,

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,000
green, and blue need to be mixed together to make a particular color.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,860
If you want to use these,

44
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,200
it's a big help to have a color picker,

45
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,774
a tool to choose the color you want to see and what the numerical code for it is.

46
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:03,560
Fortunately, there's one of those built right into

47
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,800
your browser's developer tools. Check this out.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,630
Select any of the color values in the displayed styles and you can mouse

49
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,609
around and check out different colors on

50
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,810
the page and see what the color codes for them are.

51
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,199
You can even shift click on the color's watch for the value

52
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,429
to cycle between the different color modes: RGB,

53
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,520
HSL, the name, and then the hex value. Neat.
