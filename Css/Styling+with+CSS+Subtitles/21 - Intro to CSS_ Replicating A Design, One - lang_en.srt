00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,094
So, here's the approach that I took to make this HTML look like the design.

2
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:09,509
The first thing I did was actually to turn a border on around each list item.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,000
Even though we don't need that border in the final version,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,379
it helps me see how they're being laid out.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,010
Then, I set a width and a height on both the big box and the little boxes inside it.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,760
The container gets to be 300 pixels high and wide,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,335
and each item inside gets to be 90 pixels high and wide.

8
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:31,019
Now, it just looks like a big long column of boxes.

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,579
So, now I'll turn flex on and oh great,

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,364
now it's a big long row of boxes.

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:41,484
But if I turn on flex-wrap: wrap.

12
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:44,219
Then, hey wow, now we're making progress.

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,789
This looks really close to the layout we want except the text is all too small,

14
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,585
but we can fix that.

15
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:53,615
I'll set the font pretty big 80 pixels.

16
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:58,550
The design used a sans-serif font instead of this default serif font.

17
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:03,044
So, I'll add that next and there's this nice light blue background color.

18
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:04,799
Let's put that on too.

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,834
Now, we're really close.

20
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,894
In the design, there's a margin between the boxes,

21
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:15,590
so I'll set margin: 5px and that doesn't look right.

22
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,564
Oh, they're too wide because of that border I put on them.

23
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:21,439
I'll take that off now.

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,045
Now, we've got to get these dots off.

25
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:28,439
They're here because the original HTML started out with these as list items.

26
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,774
This is something that I had to look up,

27
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:36,675
but hey right there in the search results list-style: none.

28
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:39,649
Let me try that and hey that worked.

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,868
Now, there's just one thing wrong,

30
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,200
which is that all of these x's and o's are off center,

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,475
we want them to be centered.

32
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:52,549
Something else to look up search engine center text CSS and here

33
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:59,009
I found the answer in the CSS documentation in MDM text-align: center,

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,600
and with that we've matched the original design. Awesome.
