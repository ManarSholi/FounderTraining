00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,384
CSS also lets you combine selectors.

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:08,879
For instance, you might want to say ''Make emphasized text red,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,275
but only if it's part of a list item.''

4
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:12,990
Here's how you would do that,

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,835
in the selector part of the rule,

6
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,850
you write the selector for the parent element Li,

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,620
and then for the child element em.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:27,900
Together, this selector means 'Select every em element that's a child of an Li element.

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,044
With that style applied,

10
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:33,640
this html will look like this.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,814
The em element in the list item,

12
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:38,544
turns red, but the other em doesn't,

13
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,575
because it's not part of an Li.

14
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:45,350
This kind of selector that uses a space to create a combined selector,

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,030
Li space em, is called the descendant selector.

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,500
There are actually a whole bunch of other kinds of selectors in CSS.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,210
I'm going to suggest you take a look at

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,000
the Mozilla CSS documentation for selectors if you'd like to see more of them though.
