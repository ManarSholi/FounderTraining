1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
All right. My approach is pretty similar to Carl's but I did a few things differently.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,919
I'll walk you through my steps.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,039
To start, I set the sizes of my elements so I'd have something tangible to work with.

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,599
I opened up the image and an application on my computer to see how wide the original

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,565
was and then I made a best guess on how I wanted to size my boxes.

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,984
Three boxes across 300 pixels.

7
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:30,184
So let's say, 100 pixels for each box.

8
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:33,269
I also want to have a bit of space in between,

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,930
so I'll add a margin of five pixels.

10
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:37,570
With my long column,

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,350
I needed to get my list items to go three by three in a grid.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,170
In comes float.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,405
Float allows items with a set width to float up into the next available space on a page.

14
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:52,219
With my big box set to 300 pixels,

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,379
I can float up to 300 pixels worth of items into the first row.

16
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,689
Only two list items are available to span across each row.

17
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,864
Let's look at that math again.

18
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,734
It must be because of my additional margins.

19
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:11,959
Well, let's resize the small boxes to accommodate

20
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,625
the margins to fit inside the big box width. That's better.

21
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:21,109
But it looks like the boxes are in the wrong order.

22
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:24,215
Using float right, it looks like the boxes

23
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:27,689
filled the rightmost space until the width is full.

24
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,929
Instead, I want to fill the leftmost space to keep the ordering consistent.

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,200
Let's change that here.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
All right, now we're getting somewhere.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,545
The rest of the corrections are the same as Carl's solution.

28
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:45,049
We need to get rid of the list dots,

29
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,780
increase the font size,

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,064
center the text, and set the font family to remove serifs.

31
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,230
In addition, I want to set the background color

32
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,555
of each of the boxes to match the sample image.

33
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,575
It looks like light blue,

34
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:01,310
so I'll set it to that color.

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,280
Sweet. So, that's another approach to

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,479
creating a website rendition of the tic-tac-toe design.
