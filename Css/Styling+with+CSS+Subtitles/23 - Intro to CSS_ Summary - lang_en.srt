00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
Wow. You've learned a lot in this lesson,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,025
and some of the things that you've learned have been pretty advanced.

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:09,750
Tree structures are actually not something that

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,835
computer science students learn about until several months into a typical CS curriculum.

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,655
By learning CSS and HTML,

6
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:23,039
you've also mastered two computer languages that have very different syntax.

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,265
The grammar of HTML is built around elements made with tags.

8
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:33,015
The grammar of CSS is based on rule sets written with selectors and declarations.

9
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:38,134
Visually, CSS code and HTML code look really different,

10
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:40,699
but they do work closely together.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,359
You've also seen that it's possible to do the same thing in

12
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:50,049
different ways such as by using a style tag or a linked style sheet file.

13
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,714
This is something that will keep coming up as you learn more.

14
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:57,440
In computing, there are often lots of ways to do something.

15
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,960
Depending on the requirements of a project,

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,605
you may find yourself doing one or the other of these things.

17
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:07,009
Up ahead, you'll be putting together a project that includes

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:13,040
both HTML and CSS and can also include other resources like images.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,690
When you submit that project,

20
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:18,524
make sure to put all of the files that your project needs into a folder.

21
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:22,565
Zip up that folder and then submit the zip file.

22
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:26,509
This is your chance to be big and bold with your work.

23
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,635
It's important to meet the general project requirements,

24
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:32,770
but we also want you to have fun with this project.

25
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:35,724
Be inspired by your favorite websites,

26
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:40,144
but of course make sure all the work you submit is your own.

27
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:46,114
Now this project will be a bit more involved as you will be evaluated based on a rubric.

28
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:48,484
Make sure to check your work to see if it meets

29
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:52,019
all the project requirements before you submit your project.

30
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,619
Our expert reviewers will happily give you

31
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,380
feedback on your work and will either mark your project

32
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:03,000
as requires changes or meets specifications. Good luck.
