1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,345
When you load up a webpage,

2
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:06,240
somehow the browser takes a piece of HTML text and it

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,605
creates the two-dimensional image that appears in your browser window.

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:14,830
But what our HTML and the image on the screen made of?

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,875
Well, this HTML over here is just a piece of text.

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,969
It's made of letters, and numbers,

7
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,660
and punctuation marks, and spaces.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,545
Some of that text spells out HTML tags.

9
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:31,490
Other texts makes up the content of the page,

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,975
like the word Apple, here.

11
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,375
But this browser window,

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,965
that's a visual image,

13
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:41,335
a two-dimensional picture made of pixels on your screen,

14
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,115
it could have text in it,

15
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:46,690
or images, video, or other things.

16
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:52,219
There are things in HTML source code that don't show up on the screen,

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,299
like the literal text of these tags.

18
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:01,019
There are things that show up on the screen that don't literally appear in the HTML,

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,680
like the number two, here.

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,665
It turns out that this is a little easier to

21
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:10,740
understand if we look at this intermediate step.

22
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,304
The browser reads the HTML and it turns it into something here,

23
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:21,555
and then it turns that something into the view that we see on the screen.

24
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:24,650
When we make a style change to the page,

25
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,234
that doesn't change the structure of the HTML source code,

26
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,629
but it does change the appearance.

27
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,454
That means the style is getting mixed in with this thing here.

28
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:38,245
This something is a data structure.

29
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:43,045
It's an organized map of what's going to end up on the page.

30
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:46,870
It's also what developer tools let's us look at.

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,895
When the browser reads the HTML source,

32
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:52,849
it builds up a map in the computer's memory of

33
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:56,434
what all the elements are that it will need to put on the screen.

34
00:01:56,435 --> 00:02:01,715
This map shows which elements are nested inside which other elements.

35
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:07,200
Doing this step first makes it much more practical to lay out the elements on the screen.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,844
It's like making an outline of the page.

37
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:14,419
This kind of structure is called a tree structure,

38
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:19,039
because each element can have branches coming out of it to other elements.

39
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,629
For each element, there will be branches

40
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,930
going to that elements that are nested inside of it,

41
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,795
like these LI or list items inside the OL or ordered list,

42
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:35,819
all the way down to the individual pieces of text that occur inside the list.

43
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,995
The particular tree structure that the browser builds out of HTML

44
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:44,525
is called the DOM or Document Object Model.

45
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:48,724
The DOM has a tree structure for each HTML element,

46
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:51,194
and for each piece of text, and image,

47
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:54,519
and other object inside the webpage.
